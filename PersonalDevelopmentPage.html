        <b>Adaptability</b><br><br>
        I possess the ability to quickly adjust to new situations and environments. Adapting to change comes naturally to me, and I thrive in dynamic situations. This strength allows me to navigate challenges with ease.<br><br>
        <b>Artistic Talent</b><br><br>
        Art has always been one of my passions. I frequently engage in creative activities like drawing, which not only serves as a source of enjoyment but also enhances my artistic skills.<br><br>
        <b>Empathy</b><br><br>
        I place a high value on understanding and empathizing with others. Empathy fosters strong connections with people, and I continuously work to develop this quality as it enhances my ability to relate to and support others.

        <font size="4"><u>Reflections on Twelve Pillars</u></font><br><br>
        In the 4th chapter of Twelve Pillars, Michael discusses his feelings of not living up to his potential with Charlie. Charlie's advice is simple yet profound: write down your goals. This serves two purposes â€“ it makes you establish clear goals, and it brings those goals closer to reality. Writing down goals creates awareness and commitment to achieving them, from long-term to monthly objectives.<br><br>
        This chapter's insights on goal-setting were eye-opening. I had not realized the importance of putting goals in writing. I now look forward to documenting my goals to propel my career forward.<br><br>
        Chapter 5 delves into time management. Michael worries about having enough time for his goals amidst life's responsibilities. Charlie introduces the concept that everyone must choose between two types of pain: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. Regret crushes you, while discipline is a lighter burden. Many people succumb to the urgency of daily tasks, neglecting the importance of long-term goals.<br><br>
        This lesson will be invaluable as I enter the workforce. It emphasizes the significance of staying disciplined to achieve long-term goals, ensuring I do not succumb to life's urgencies and regrets.<br><br>
        In the 6th chapter, Charlie discusses the influence of friends on one's life path. Associating with people who possess attributes you admire is key. However, I believe in maintaining connections with long-time friends, even if they haven't achieved great success. Supportive friends are essential in times of struggle, and while I agree with the importance of surrounding oneself with successful individuals, I believe in balancing this with loyalty to friends.<br><br>
        Chapter 7 underscores the value of self-education. Formal education can secure a living, but self-education can lead to prosperity. Charlie recommends reading books by successful individuals to gain knowledge. While this may encourage book sales, I do recognize the importance of continuous learning.<br><br>
        This chapter has inspired me to remain dedicated to learning, even beyond college, to further enhance my knowledge and skills.<br><br><br> <a href="HomePage.html">Return</a>
